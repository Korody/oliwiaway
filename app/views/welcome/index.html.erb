        <strong>oliwia</strong>
        behind her black velvet hair, she is a shy and charming girl who learned how to enjoy life intensively. she was born healthier than any other child around her, but was soon left alone. no family or friends understood her excessive love. love for smiling, dancing, running, creating and inspiring others around her. instead of one heart, she was born with two and carried them in her hands. when she was just a little girl she found herself in a unique situation, where life could be filled of dreams and fantasies. welcome to the world where she found her path to happiness.
